# Privacy Policy for Gmail Confetti Extension

*Last Updated: March 19, 2025*

## Introduction

Thank you for using the Gmail Confetti Extension ("we," "our," "us"). This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding data collection, usage, and disclosure related to our Chrome browser extension.

## Summary

**The Gmail Confetti Extension does not collect, use, store, or transmit any personal data or user information whatsoever.**

## How Our Extension Works

The Gmail Confetti Extension operates entirely within your browser. It simply:

1. Activates when you visit Gmail (mail.google.com)
2. Monitors for when you click the "Send" button in Gmail's interface
3. Displays a confetti animation on your screen when an email is sent
4. All functionality runs locally on your device and does not transmit any data to external servers

## Data Collection

We do not collect, use, store, transfer, or process:
- Personal information
- Usage statistics
- Analytics data
- Email content or metadata
- Browsing history
- Contact information
- Any other user data

## Browser Permissions

Our extension requires the following permissions for the sole purpose described:

- **activeTab**: To identify when the "Send" button is clicked on Gmail's interface
- **Access to mail.google.com**: To function specifically on Gmail's website

These permissions are used exclusively for providing the extension's functionality and not for data collection.

## Third-Party Components

Our extension uses a modified version of the open-source canvas-confetti library to render the confetti animation. This library operates entirely within your browser and does not collect or transmit any data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will provide notification through our Chrome Web Store page or extension. We encourage you to periodically review this policy.
